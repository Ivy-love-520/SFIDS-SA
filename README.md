# SFIDS-SA
Adaptive Suppression of Single-Frequency Interference
The test.m program is a test program, and all signals used in it are synthetic signals.
The real_signal_process.m program is for actual signal testing. To use it, simply change the name of the imported data to run it.
All programs have been tested. If the main program cannot be used, run the Test_ourdata.m program first.
